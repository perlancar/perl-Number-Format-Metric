Revision history for SHARYANTO-Number-Util

0.57    2014-04-07 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes.

        - Fix some broken tests by changing LANG to LC_ALL [thanks Slaven
          Rezic, CT#94487].


0.56    2013-09-10 (SHARYANTO)

        - No functional changes. Split from SHARYANTO-Utils to minimize
          dependencies (I'm trying to make Text::ANSITable work under Windows).
